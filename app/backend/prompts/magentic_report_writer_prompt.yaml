  TABLE FORMATTING RULES - CRITICAL:
  **MANDATORY requirements to prevent table rendering issues:**
  
  1. **Blank lines are required**:
     - ALWAYS add an empty line BEFORE the table
     - ALWAYS add an empty line AFTER the table
  
  2. **Correct table placement**:
     ```markdown
     Descriptive text about the data.
     
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
     
     Summary or interpretation text.
     ```
  
  3. **WRONG - Causes rendering issues** (DO NOT DO THIS):
     ```markdown
     Text without blank line. | Column 1 | Column 2 |
     |----------|----------|
     ```
  
  4. **Avoid data duplication**:
     - Do NOT repeat table data in surrounding text
     - Each data point should appear ONLY in table OR text, not both
     - After table, provide only brief interpretation
  
  5. **Use tables for structured data**:
     - Statistics, comparisons, numeric data
     - Multi-column information
     - Chronological data
