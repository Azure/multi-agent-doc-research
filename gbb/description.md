## Overview
![Architecture Diagram](images/multi-agent-doc-research-architecture-Page-2.png)

his AI-powered chatbot performs custom deep research on uploaded documents using a semantic chunking strategy for precise and meaningful vectorization. Through multi-agent collaboration, it delivers accurate, context-aware answers to user queries.

Built with FastAPI, Azure OpenAI, and Chainlit, the system showcases advanced techniques for enhancing LLM-based applicationsâ€”such as agentic patterns, modular architecture, multi-agent orchestration, and evaluation support.

At its core, the multi-agent deep research engine combines Semantic Kernel and the Microsoft Agent Framework to generate high-quality analytical reports. By employing group chat coordination and a magnetic multi-agent pattern, it achieves deeper reasoning and consistent, well-structured outputs.
