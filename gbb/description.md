Planning & Search Chatbot Using Agentic Patterns

![Architecture Diagram](images/plan-search-architecture1.png)

The Plan & Search Chatbot transforms open-ended questions into grounded, multi-step answers through intelligent query rewriting and agentic planning. With Azure OpenAI, Semantic Kernel, FastAPI, and ready-to-run KR/EN frontends, itâ€™s built for rapid demos, real-time grounding, and production-ready pilots.

The Plan & Search Chatbot is a production-ready reference that turns open-ended questions into grounded answers by rewriting queries, performing agentic planning formulti-step search tasks, and executing them in parallel. It ships with Azure OpenAISDK & Semantic Kernel both implementations, a FastAPI backend, evaluation/CIartifacts, pluggable tools and data (e.g., YouTube via MCP server), verbose tracing, andready-to-run Gradio/Chainlit frontends with KR/EN toggle and feature configuration forrapid demos and pilots. It also supports Bing Search API or Grounding with Bing for real-time web grounding and governance/cost flexibility.
